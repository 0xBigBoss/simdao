# https://simDAO.io/ - simDAO by ShadowX

A DAO proposal simulator and DAO analytics powered by <a href="https://Snapshot.org" target="_blank">Snapshot.org</a>. Hold mock proposals to understand how each voter influences the DAOs governance. Each voters influence is based on several factors, that are involved in the DAO, and individual voting. Train the simDAO model by simulating votes.
